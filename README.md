# v1-basic-calculator.js

This project is a **basic JavaScript calculator** built using only core JavaScript concepts.
It is part of my learning journey while practicing conditions, user input, and basic logic.

The calculator works entirely with `prompt()` and `alert()` and does not use HTML buttons or the DOM.

## 🚀 Features

- Takes two numbers from the user
- Takes an operator from the user
- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Power (`**`)
  - Modulo (`%`)
- Validates user input
- Handles division or modulo by zero
- Displays the result using `alert()`

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

This project helped me practice and understand:

- `prompt()` for user input
- `alert()` for output
- `Number()` for type conversion
- `isNaN()` for input validation
- `if / else if / else` conditions
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`)
- Comparison operators (`===`)
- Basic error handling
- Writing readable and structured JavaScript code

---

## 🧮 How It Works

1. The user enters the first number
2. The user chooses an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`)
3. The user enters the second number
4. The program:
   - Checks if the inputs are valid numbers
   - Prevents division or modulo by zero
   - Executes the selected operation
5. The result is shown using an alert

---

## 🛑 Error Handling

The calculator checks for:
- Invalid number inputs
- Division or modulo by zero
- Invalid operators

If an error is found, an appropriate message is displayed instead of crashing the program.

## 📌 Example

Input:
First number: 10
Operator: *
Second number: 5



Output:
50

## 🔜 Next Steps (Future Versions)

- Loop the calculator so it runs multiple times
- Add a menu instead of typing operators
- Convert it to an HTML-based calculator
- Use `switch` instead of multiple `if` statements
